# Getting Started with Create React App

The demo allows you to enter 1 or 2 applicants salaries and any additional incomes which you can take the sum of for their total income. Then enter multiple liabilities in the form of any loans or credit cards they have, take the sum of these for their total liabilities. Finally ask how much deposit they have.

The form will show a summary of the various totals, but also let them know the total amount they can borrow and what property price they can afford the values of which can be requested from a simple API we have setup.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
